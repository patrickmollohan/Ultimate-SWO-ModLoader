## DESCRIPTION

This is a DLL file based on Ultimate ASI Loader that adds mod support and ASI plugin loading functionality.

## INSTALLATION

To install, copy [dinput8.dll](https://github.com/patrickmollohan/Ultimate-SWO-ModLoader/releases/download/v1.0.0/dinput8.dll) into the root directory of the game (where "Outlaws.exe" is). This is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Star Wars Outlaws

## MODDING

After installing Ultimate SWO ModLoader, you may copy any modified game files relative to the root directory of the game. Be sure to keep file names and folder structures the same!

You can use programs such as DTZxPorter's [Hunter](https://dtzxporter.com/tools/hunter) to extract the game files.

## ASI LOADING

Since this modloader is based on Ultimate ASI Loader, you can put additional ASI files in the "scripts" folder in the root directory of the game to add functionality to the game. If the folder does not exist (it doesn't by default), create it.
