## DESCRIPTION

This is a DLL file based on Ultimate ASI Loader that adds mod support and ASI plugin loading functionality. Additionally, it enables disk caching, resulting in better hard drive performance over time.

## INSTALLATION

To install, copy [dinput8.dll](https://github.com/patrickmollohan/Ultimate-SWO-ModLoader/releases/latest/download/dinput8.dll) into the root directory of the game (where "Outlaws.exe" is). This is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Star Wars Outlaws

## MODDING

After installing Ultimate SWO ModLoader, you may copy any modified game files relative to the root directory of the game. Be sure to keep file names and folder structures the same!

You can use programs such as DTZxPorter's [Hunter](https://dtzxporter.com/tools/hunter) to extract the game files.

## ASI LOADING

Since this modloader is based on Ultimate ASI Loader, you can put additional ASI files in the "scripts" folder in the root directory of the game to add functionality to the game. If the folder does not exist (it doesn't by default), create it.

## DISK CACHE ENABLER

This DLL now also enables the use of Windows's file caching, which should result in less hard drive activity over time. This may allow the game to run on HDDs and should also result in slightly better SSD performance as well.
