# Ultimate Star Wars Outlaws ModLoader

## DESCRIPTION

This is a DLL file based on Ultimate ASI Loader that adds mod support and ASI plugin loading functionality.

## INSTALLATION

## MODDING

After installing Ultimate SWO ModLoader, you may copy any modified game files relative to the root directory of the game. Be sure to keep file names and folder structures the same!

## ASI LOADING

Since this modloader is based on Ultimate ASI Loader, you can put additional ASI files in the 'scripts' folder.

## CrashDumps

ASI loader is now capable of generating crash minidumps and crash logs. To use this feature, create a folder named `CrashDumps` in the folder with asi loader's dll. You can disable that via the `DisableCrashDumps=1` ini option.
